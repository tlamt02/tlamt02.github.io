I am using Academic Pages on Github Pages template for building my personal website profile.


# Getting Started

Updated: with stand of 03.18.2025: Some concepts are vague and there have been numerous ways to map them into designs. I find using the approach of descriptive analysis to be much more suitable for this purpose. Slowly resuming after taking things into abstraction and updating objects into their subdivision.

##Tools for abstraction 

1. Cellular structure analysis by categories
  a. Mechanical movement
  b. Linear regression
  c. Threshholded oscillation

About network paths: Each nodes are contributing to shifting edge lengths or surrounding a hub.

## Progress

1. Tested Git

## Quoting directories

Any suggestion or improvement is welcomed! Feel free to hit me up
