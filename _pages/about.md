IÂ´m currently doing my Master in Biophysics. From within the domains of Life Science, I am keen on finding a systematic patch for overlapping regions. Recently introduced to theoretical scope, I find that generalisation and clustering are suiatable for this work. These methods usually shed light on further possiblities to connect things to the nanoscale. 

A) Nanoscale
Protein X-ray structure
------
After a protein was crystallized successfully, its 3-dimensional structure can be analyzed with a soure of X-ray beam. Information gained from these experiments provides many Biochemists with the correct conformation for their protein of interest. 


B) Microscale
Imaging cells with Light Microscope
------
The topic of Tissue clearing and its application in Neuroimaging opens up windows for inspecting selective areas. With Light-sheet Microscopy we can easily view a whole 3D brain volume of rodent mice. This insight provides further direction for other researches in the field of Neuroscience.
